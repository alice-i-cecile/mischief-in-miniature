# Mischief in Miniature

> Tiny terrors wreak charming chaos.

An open source 3D action-platformer made in Bevy. Inspired by Katamari Damacy, this game is about toys coming to life, wreaking havoc in homes across the world before they're caught.

This project was created to dogfood Bevy: testing its capabilities in earnest to find problems, while also teaching others about the engine.
If we're lucky, we'll even get a sweet game out of it!
If this game is sold, all profits will go to the Bevy Foundation <3
